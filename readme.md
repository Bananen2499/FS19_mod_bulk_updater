Updates all the mods in your mod folder to the latest version. No more updating each mod individually!

py ./update_mods.py -f "path to mod-directory"
```
### Help
```
py .\update_mods.py -h
usage: mod updater [-h] -f MOD_DIR

Commandline tool to update mods in FS19.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f MOD_DIR, --mod-dir MOD_DIR
                        Path to mod-directory (usually "HOME/my games/FarmingSimulator2019/mods/")

There is no guarantee that this will work when you use it, please don't be mad.
